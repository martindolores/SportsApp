View Betting Markets from Selected Sports and from Selected Bookmakers

---------------------------------------------
Welcome to my Sports App!
---------------------------------------------
This application provides users the ability to view a selection of sports and the betting market from their selected bookmakers (in Australia) . In order to get the connection working,
you must update the API key.

The API I used for this application is called "The Odds API" and can be found here: https://the-odds-api.com/. Apply for an API Key, insert your API key in the classes
found in sportsapp/classes. This will add the connection and your as good as gold! :)

Functionality

From the dashboard you can pick from six different sports. 

In each sport, you can choose a particular league. This will provide you a list of all upcoming matches. Once you have chosen the particular match, you can choose 
your preferred bookmaker and what market you would like to see.
